# Lending-Club-Loan-Data

This **Project** is [Dataquest's](https://www.dataquest.io/course/machine-learning-project) Monthly Challenge for the month of October, 2016.

In this challenge, we are to explore using [past loan data from Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) to build models that can predict if a loan will be paid off on time or not.

## Approach :

We are looking at the problem from the **conservative investor's** standpoint -- we are more interested in a low **False Positive Rate(FPR)** than a high **True Positive Rate(TPR)**


## Goal:

Construct a machine learning model that achieves a **TPR greater than 50%** while maintaining a **FPR less than 7%**.
