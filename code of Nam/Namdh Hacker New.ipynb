    "From this analysis it came to my understanding that by consistently posting about Hiring related questions, the author 'whoishiring' received the top number of comments. So talking about Hiring process can be a good idea. But after going through Hacker News portal, I understood that this is a periodic post created by the team behind Hacker News to help with the recruitment process. So maybe this is not where my friend should focus.\n",

    "Second highest commented post asks about Tools, third one about making profits from Amazon, fourth one about given books and the fifth one funding at YC Research. So there are a few things I could possibly infer from these topics.\n",

    "* Ask a simple question that everyone can relate to, and people will respond, for eg about an obsolete tool. Maybe talk about MS Paint and some people might get all nostalgic while others talk about it being completely obsolete.\n",
    "* Ask about something that can make people curious, such as some one's online earning from Amazon or blog etc\n",
    "* Ask about things that everyone has some kind of opinion on, for eg what would you tell your book given as a gift.\n",
    "* Ask about any open topic in funding, might create an engaging discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one can find simple, genuine yet curious, at times controversial topics that can create emotions in people, which also have connection with the life experience, I think they can create some popular posts on Hacker News channel. That is what I am able to infer from this data set.\n",
